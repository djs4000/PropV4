# Proposal: Countdown Effects

This proposal introduces new visual and audio effects for the match countdown period.

When a match enters the `Countdown` status, the device will:
1.  Display a low-brightness white light on the LEDs.
2.  In the final 3 seconds, flash a bright white light and play a beep each second.

This provides clear, synchronized feedback to players that the match is about to begin.
